Go Service:
- we need to convert the given source file into Dockerfile so that we can create a docker image.
- I created multi stage build for Go service to reduce the Docker Image Size

Python Service:
- Same as Go service, we need to write a dockerfile to convert it into docker image.


NGINX SETUP:
- nginx should run locally.
- we have to customise nginx default configuration to serve as reverse proxy.

- localhost:8080/service1/ping & localhost:8080/service1/hello should route traffic to Go service running locally on port 8001.
- localhost:8080/service2/ping & localhost:8080/service2/hello should route traffic to Python service running locally on port 8002.

- now after adding desired configuration, we need to create a custom nginx docker image using a base  nginx image.


Docker-compose file:
- need to create a default network for all services.
- add healthchecks for containers
